Introduction to ReNomQ
======================
**ReNomQ is a SDK & PythonAPI for developing applications for quantum computers.**

Concept
--------
The concept of ReNomQ is to make it easy to do quantum computations performed by quantum computers, and to make it easy for users to manipulate quantum computers.

Currently, there are a number of application development frameworks for quantum computers, but many of them require in-depth knowledge of quantum computers in order to use them.

With ReNomQ, you can easily create quantum circuits and perform quantum calculations with python code.

ReNomQ can be used in the same way as alreading existing machine learning API, but using quantum calculations on quantum computers in the backend.
